# Welcome to Candidate Code

This README file has been created by the Candidate Code platform.

Before you send this challenge to a real candidate, you'll want to either change or remove this file and add your own challenge's code. 

### If you've been sent this as part of an assignment

* It's likely your team is testing us out for the first time
* You have cloned this from a repository created specially for this assignment
* Try committing and pushing some changes to this file (or adding others)
* The person that sent you this will able to see any changes in a diff on the assignment page in Candidate Code
* They can also comment, adding ratings, etc. from that page
* After you've finished, Ask them to invite you to the team so can see the results too

### If you've cloned this repository from the challenge page

* This repository **acts as a template for the coding challenges** you send to candidates.
* The `master` branch of this repository becomes the **starting point** for a candidate's code challenge
* When a challenge is later assigned to a candidate **a new, separate repository will be created** for them to work in
* The history of the template repository will **not be visible** to a candidate. They will only see one `Initial Commit` created from the master branch of the template.
